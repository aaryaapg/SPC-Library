/* This is the Header file for the SPC Library
 *  SPC stands for Square, Peaks and Counts. 
 *  This library is signal conditioning, where an Analog input is to be analyzed.
 *  The analog signal is converted into a square wave based on the threshold value given by the user, and positive edges are counted.
 *  Release Date: 29/12/2020
