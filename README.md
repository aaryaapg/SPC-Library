# SPC-Library
An Arduino Library for easy signal conditioning of Analog Signals. SPC stands for Square, Peaks and Counts. This library can be used for signal conditioning, where an Analog input is to be analyzed. The analog signal is converted into a square wave based on the threshold value given by the user, and positive edges are counted. It can be used for any analog sensor
